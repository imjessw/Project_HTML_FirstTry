  <h2> 2012 to January 2013</h2>
  <Body> 2012 was the worst year ever, luckily january 10th,2013 changed my life. That's when everything changed for me. I got a job with my first start up and committed to a list of about fifty things that i would accomplish in 2013. Taking my life in my hands I set out to see what I was capable of. My challenge and mantra for this year will be...<blockquote> <B><q>Surround yourself with the smartest people you can find and do something you are not quite ready to do</q> - Marissa Mayer</b></blockquote> </body>

  <h3><em> SXSW 2013</em></h3>
<p> My experience at SXSW was so inspiring to me that I committed there to be a positive influence in the tech world. I volunteered for several startups and just took a chance in expanding my knowledge of this wonderful world of new tech. Bellow is one of the teams I worked with, Music Mogal. </p>
